      "Oxygen is a key ingredient for life, the most abundant element on Earth, where we derive our energy from, and the basis for achieving beautiful, healthy-looking skin – both inside and out. It’s critical to all normal functions of the body’s tissues – including, but not limited to, the appearance of the skin. As we age, the amount of oxygen stored in our skin tissues diminishes. As a result, we use oxygen in all our products as a delivery method at Oxygen Botanicals, coupled with botanical extracts and complexes that have been scientifically proven to leave the skin feeling healthy and looking beautiful. Replenishing oxygen lost over time helps reverse the signs of aging and helps to maintain and regain the natural beauty of our skin.",
